Questionnaire: 

1. What are javascript functions?

Javascript functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a particular task/operation.
While we could just rewrite code over and over, in the spirit of "don't repeat yourself" (DRY),
it is best to put reused code into functions.

2. Explain call-back functions in your own words.

A callback function is a function that is passed into another function as an argument and is "invoked" 
when the outmost function is called. Written without promises, async/await, or .then, these functions
are "synchronous". There are both synchronous and asynchronous callbacks.

3. Why are javascript functions first-class citizens? (in your own words, please)
Functions are considered first-class citizens because of their abilities to be used in various ways
along with being used even when written out of order.

Functions as first class citizens allows them to be used in the following ways among others:
-stored as a value i.e.
   const hello = function() { console.log("hello") return "hello"};
-passed as an argument to another function
   function sayHello(hello) { return `${hello()} World`};

4. Explain javascript Closures in your own words.

Closures deal with the scope of a function's access to variables and references surrounding it.
They are created whenever you create a function. a function inside another function would then
have access to the outer functions references.

5. When/Why do you use the .then() method of a promise?

6. When/Why do you use the .catch() method of a promise?

7. What is the spread operator?

8. What is the rest operator?


9. What is the difference between the rest operator and the spread operator?
